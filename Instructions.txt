The main feature of the web app is the course map. After logging in as the user, you will see the user dashboard.
Here the user can manage all of their course plans, which includes editing course plans, making them public, opening
the plan itself, and going to the public plans page. Here, select view course map button to be taken to the map
page for that course, or click on the public page button on the navbar to browse all publically listed course plans.

When the user selects a course map they will be taken to the page to view that course map. This page comprises the main
functionality of our web app, where you can see a visual representation of your course map and interact with it. Here,
click on add course in the bottom right to open the course search screen and search for courses and add them.
You can select a year and a semester for the course, with a maximum year of 4, and the course are automatically
positioned according to their year and semester and relative to other courses. Arrows are automatically added to
show course prerequisites, and mousing over a course will highlight all of it's prerequiste courses.
Additionally, you can click on a course in the graph to see more information about it, set it as in-progress,
or leave a review. Reviews are out of 5 stars and also include an optional text portion. In this dialog, the user
can also click a button to browse all reviews for that course.

On the dashboard, there is also a button to make the course plan public. This adds the course to the public listing of
courses which anyone can browse. Each publically listed course plan can also be reviewed, which is done by clicking
on reviews and then leave review and it contains the same information as a course review. Each course map can also
be viewed and if the user likes it then they can add it to their own list of course plans by clicking import.

Admin users have additional capabilities so that they can moderate the website. They can delete reviews for both
courses and course plans to ensure all reviews are of high quality. They can ban users in case any users are hostile
and they can also permanently delete the user's account in case it is inactive.
